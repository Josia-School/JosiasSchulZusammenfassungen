## diffusion & osmosis
All molecule move at a temperature greater than 0K. If it is a solid, it only jiggles but still moves. That movement is random.
Movement will mostly go from a region with high concentration to a region with low concentration.  Therefore, molecules will spread everywhere.
That's called diffusion and its speed depends on temperature.

The same can happen trough a selective permeable membrane. In that case we call it osmosis.
We call a solution isotonic if its concentration is the same as in the cell.
We call a solution Hypertonic if its concentraition is higher than in the cell.
We call a solution Hypotonic if its concentraition is lower than in the cell.

## meiosis/recombination/non-disjunction
The goal of meiosis is to create haploid cells out of diploid cells (for reproduction).


### Mytosis (as reminder):

#### Interphase

Interphase is the normal working phase. It grows. If the cell plans on dividing, the DNA duplicates. (consists of g1, s, g2)


#### Prophase

* Chromosomes condense. (get shorter and thicker)
* Nuclear envelopes break down.
* Spindles grow out of centrosomes which are located on opposite poles. 


#### Metaphase

* Chromosomes align at equator.
* Spindles are fully grown and attach to each sister chromatid.


#### Anaphase

* The centromere (which holds sister chromatids together) divides. And the spindles pull the sister chromatids apart.


#### Telophase

* The chromatids reach opposite ends of cell. 2 new nuclear envelopes form and chromosomes decondense. Spindles disappear.

### Meiosis:

0. Interphase
1. Prophase I --> one diploid cell with double-chromatid chromosomes. (Here sister chromatids can exchange parts)
2. Metaphase I --> Spindles connect to homologous pairs.
3. Anaphase I --> Seperate homologous pairs
4. Telophase I (& cell division) --> cell division (now we have two diploid cells)
5. Metaphase II --> Spindles connect to centromeres.
6. Anaphase II --> seperate sister chromatids.
7. Telophase II (& cell division) --> cell division (now we have four haploid cells (different from mother cell))


### Recombination

Because the distribution of the homologue pairs is random, there are many possible outcomes for the daughter cells in meiosis.
During prophase 1 the sister chromatids lie very close to each other. They can exchange parts, which makes more variation possible.


### non-disjunction

During Meiosis mistakes can happen at Anaphase I/II. It can happen, that not exactly half of the chromosones are in the two resulting cells.
That results in aneuploidy (trisomy or monosomy (mostly lethal)). The older the mother is, the higher is the chance of such a mistake, because the sisterchromatids lie together longer.

Aneuploidy of sex chromosomes is oftern viable, because only one X chromosone is required. If there are more, it doesn't matter. If there are some Y that also doesn't matter. Following syndromes exist:

| Turner | Poly-X | Klinefelter | Diplo-Y |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| X0 | XXX | XXY | XYY |
 

## spermatogenesis

There is one primordial germ cell. If sperm cells are produced, this cell gets divided. Then, it goes through Meiosis and at the end forms a sperm cell.


## oogenesis

The eggs do cell division in the embrio. At birth, all the egg cells are there. (Diploid / double chromatid-chromosomes)
From Puberty on, the egg cells will end meiosis I (from prophase I) and start with meiosis II. All the material will stay at one of the daughter cell. The other one just becomes a polar body.
Meiosis II only finishes (from metaphase II), if the egg gets Fertilized.


## egg cell & sperm cell

## fertilisation

0. The sperm cells are around the egg cell.
1. The sperm cells come in contact with the zona pellucida.
2. The acrosome in the head of the sperm cell gets released.
3. The released acrosome digests the zona pellucida.
4. The sperm cell can enter the perivitelline space.
5. The sperm cell fuses with the cell membrane of the egg.
6. Two processes are started to block other sperm cells from getting in the cell:
    * Fast block: Eggs cell membrane depolarizes
    * Slow block: cortical granules release their content
7. The nucleus of the sperm cell goes through the eggs membrane
8. Egg cell finishes meiosis II
9. Nucleus of egg and sperm fuse and create the zygote.
